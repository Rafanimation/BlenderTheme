# BlenderThemeOnlyWhite

 click on the "Edit" menu, then select "Preferences," and then choose "Themes." Click the "Install" button at the top, locate the "OnlyWhite.xml" file.

 Be careful, after making these changes, it might confuse you because the interface will be almost invisible due to being all white. You can revert it by pressing the reset button next to the install button we used earlier.
